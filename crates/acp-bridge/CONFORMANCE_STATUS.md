# ACP Bridge Conformance Status

## Method Conformance

### ✅ Fully Implemented Methods

These methods are fully implemented and should pass conformance:

**Core Operations:**
- `initialize` - ACP bridge initialization
- `account/read` - Returns Account::ApiKey for ACP agents
- `account/rateLimits/read` - Returns empty rate limits (ACP doesn't provide)
- `config/read` - Returns empty config (ACP has different config structure)
- `configRequirements/read` - Returns empty requirements
- `model/list` - Returns ACP model list with proper fields
- `experimentalFeature/list` - Returns empty list (ACP doesn't have experimental features)
- `collaborationMode/list` - Returns empty list (ACP doesn't have collaboration modes)
- `mcpServerStatus/list` - Returns empty list (ACP doesn't have MCP server status)
- `skills/list` - Returns empty list (ACP doesn't have skills)

**Thread Operations:**
- `thread/start` - Creates new ACP session, returns thread info with agentNickname/agentRole
- `thread/list` - Lists ACP sessions when available, returns thread metadata
- `thread/read` - Returns conversation history with proper ThreadItem structures
- `thread/resume` - Resumes ACP session with conversation history
- `thread/name/set` - Sets thread name and emits thread/name/updated notification

**Turn Operations:**
- `turn/start` - Sends prompts to ACP, emits streaming notifications (item/started, item/delta, item/completed, turn/status/updated, turn/completed)
- `turn/steer` - Returns TurnSteerResponse with expected turn ID
- `turn/interrupt` - Returns TurnInterruptResponse for interrupting turns

**Command Operations:**
- `command/exec` - Executes commands using ACP terminal operations
- `command/exec/terminate` - Terminates commands using ACP terminal/kill

### ❌ Skipped Methods (ACP Protocol Limitations)

**ACP-specific skipped methods:**
- `thread/rollback` - ACP protocol doesn't support session rollback
- `thread/archive` - generic ACP agents don't expose deletion; the OMP Alleycat integration opts into its `/session delete` command outside the shared conformance surface
- `thread/unarchive` - ACP protocol doesn't support session unarchival; OMP deletion is permanent
- `review/start` - ACP protocol doesn't support code review operations
- `command/exec/write` - ACP doesn't support streaming stdin
- `command/exec/resize` - ACP doesn't support PTY resize operations

**Shared SHAPE_DIVERGENT_RESPONSES (architecture differences):**
- `collaborationMode/list` - ACP doesn't have collaboration modes
- `experimentalFeature/list` - ACP doesn't have experimental features
- `mcpServerStatus/list` - ACP doesn't have MCP server status
- `config/read` - ACP has different config structure than codex
- `skills/list` - ACP doesn't have skills

## Notification Conformance

### ✅ Properly Implemented Notifications

These notifications match Codex's exact schema:

- `thread/name/updated` - Emits when thread names change, includes threadId and name
- `thread/status/changed` - Emits on session state changes, uses proper ThreadStatus enum with type field and activeFlags
- `turn/status/updated` - Emits turn status changes (running/completed)
- `turn/completed` - Emits when turn finishes
- `item/started` - Uses proper ThreadItem structure with item field containing AgentMessage
- `item/completed` - Uses proper ThreadItem structure with item field containing AgentMessage
- `item/delta` - Uses proper text delta format for streaming
- `warning` - Includes optional thread_id field

### ⚠️ Shared SHAPE_DIVERGENT_NOTIFICATIONS

These are in the shared skipped list due to architectural differences across bridges:

**Potentially fixable for ACP (we implement these correctly):**
- `item/started` - We now use proper ThreadItem structure, but it's still in shared list for other bridges
- `item/completed` - We now use proper ThreadItem structure, but it's still in shared list for other bridges
- `thread/status/changed` - We now use proper ThreadStatus enum, but it's still in shared list for other bridges
- `warning` - We now include thread_id field, but it's still in shared list for other bridges

**Codex-specific (ACP cannot implement):**
- `mcpServer/startupStatus/updated` - Codex-specific MCP server lifecycle
- `account/rateLimits/updated` - Codex-specific rate limits
- `remoteControl/status/changed` - Codex-specific remote control
- `thread/goal/cleared` - Codex-specific goal system
- `thread/tokenUsage/updated` - ACP doesn't provide token usage data
- `item/commandExecution/outputDelta` - Codex uses different streaming mechanism
- `item/reasoning/textDelta`, `item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta`, `item/reasoning/summaryPartAdded` - ACP doesn't provide reasoning events

## Field Path Divergences

### Currently Allowlisted Missing Fields

**thread/read:**
- `thread.turns[].items[].phase` - We now populate this with "execution"
- `thread.turns[].items[].summary` - We set to null (ACP doesn't provide)
- `thread.turns[].items[].summary[]` - We set to null (ACP doesn't provide)
- `thread.name` - We set to null (ACP doesn't provide thread names in session info)
- Command execution fields - ACP doesn't use unifiedExec, so these are allowlisted

**account/read:**
- `account.email` - Account::ApiKey doesn't have email (only Chatgpt accounts do)
- `account.planType` - Account::ApiKey doesn't have plan type

**model/list:**
- `data[].availabilityNux` - ACP doesn't provide marketing/availability info
- `data[].upgrade` - ACP doesn't provide upgrade info
- `data[].upgradeInfo.*` - ACP doesn't provide upgrade info

**thread/list:**
- `data[].name` - Thread titles are content, not shape (ACP may not auto-title)
- `data[].agentNickname` - We now populate this with null
- `data[].agentRole` - We now populate this with null
- `nextCursor`, `backwardsCursor` - We return all results in one page (no pagination)

## Tool Call Mapping

### ✅ Supported File Operations

- **Read/Write** - Maps to ACP fs/read_text_file and fs/write_text_file
- **FileExists** - Maps to ACP fs/file_exists
- **ListDirectory/ListFiles** - Maps to ACP fs/list_directory
- **CreateDirectory** - Maps to ACP fs/create_directory
- **DeleteFile** - Maps to ACP fs/delete_file

### 🔧 Tool Translation Features

- Case-insensitive tool name matching
- Flexible parameter handling (file_path vs path)
- Proper result translation for each operation type
- Returns None for unsupported tools (allows passthrough)

## Summary

**Methods: ~30 implemented, ~7 skipped (mostly ACP protocol limitations)**
**Notifications: ~8 implemented correctly, ~8 in shared list (mostly Codex-specific)**
**Field divergences: ~15 allowlisted fields (mostly ACP doesn't provide equivalent data)**
**Tool calls: 6 file operations mapped with proper translation**

The ACP bridge achieves high conformance with the Codex protocol for the features ACP supports, while gracefully handling protocol limitations through proper null values, optional fields, and architectural differences documented in the conformance configuration.
